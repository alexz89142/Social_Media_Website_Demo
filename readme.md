# Social Media Website Demo
This is a website that I created quite some time ago that just sat in my archives. When I found it I liked it a lot so I fixed it up a little to exhibit it.

The idea behind the site is that it's an eye-catching way to link to social media, so each of the floppy disks in the vending machine can be linked to a specific page on its respective website. The keypad can also be used. When fully implemented it's intended that, if you'd like, you can enter in the code that goes to the disk to access the website. It's also intended that using a special code certain effects can happen. The keypad functionality is unfinished.

Other than that, it is responsive despite using no libraries. Though [Animista](http://animista.net) was used to generate the floppy disks' animations.
